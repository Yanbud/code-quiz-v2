## Description
This is a code quiz application. When you click the start button there are a few questoins presented for you. When you answer a question incorrectly time is subbracted from the clock. When you answer all the questions or the timer reaches 0 the game is over and you can save your initials and score.  
This Code Quiz is for coding assessment. I applied some skills on it such as traverse DOM, timers intervals, event listener, data attributes and local storage.
